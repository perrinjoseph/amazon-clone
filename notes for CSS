The React context api it isnt the same as Redux but the same idea is what enables our components to communicate with a data layer.

What is useHistory from react-router-dom
from react and it is used to force push or basically navigate the page after some 
activity is a success!

now if you need to login a user used the auth.whateverwhatever in an async function

once we have signin we need to keep track of who signed in app.js we will create 
a listener that will listen for that we use somethin gcalled useEffect() it takes no 
parameters and it can be used to refire something when a user changes or if the state of somethign changes
the app component only runs once if you dont pass in anything in the array.
